# Image Captioning with GANs üñºÔ∏èü§ñ
Welcome to the Image Captioning with GANs project! This repository contains a sophisticated machine learning model that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate descriptive captions for images. By combining the capabilities of TensorFlow and PyTorch, this model achieves a remarkable 14% improvement in caption accuracy compared to traditional methods.

Project Overview
This project introduces a novel approach to image captioning by utilizing a custom GAN architecture. The goal is to automatically generate captions that are not only accurate but also contextually relevant to the images. This technology has vast applications, including aiding visually impaired users, enhancing image indexing for search engines, and automating content generation for social media platforms.
